# Advent Of Code 2022 in Javascript

Advent of Code for year 2022! Woohoo! In Javascript / Node.js, potentially npm packages included.

1) Nice and easy, could be one liner, probably.
2) There is definitely some trick with indexes in the array, but since it was not that hard I did not spend that much time to investigate it further.
3) I rewrote Utils for String and Array to a bit of prototype pollution. Ugly, but it is nicer. Anyway, day 3 was not hard, but first time I had to use debugger (split into groups of three was the easy, but ugly part lol).
4) Easy one aswell, just about boolean logic and ranges overlapping.
5) A bit of array handling. Parsing the input actually took much more time and lines of code than just moving the items in the arrays.
6) First part - ugly but cheap. Second part - simple, nice, but not that performant.
